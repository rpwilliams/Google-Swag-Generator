# GoogleSwagGenerator
I wanted a prize wheel for a Google event I was hosting. 
Prize wheels are expensive, so I tried to find a virtual one online. 
Couldn't find one, so I developed a C# program that did the same thing!

If you change the values under "options" the program will know how much
swag is left and will adjust accordingly.
