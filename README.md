# GoogleSwagGenerator

A C# program that generates a random piece of Google Swag and keeps track of swag inventory. Created for the 2016 Google birthday event at Kansas State University.

## Motivation
I wanted a prize wheel for a Google event I was hosting. Prize wheels are expensive, so I tried to find a virtual one online. 
I couldn't find one, so I developed a C# program that did the same thing.
